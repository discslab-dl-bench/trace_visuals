I had to limit most of the traces to 6 fields (max number of arguments bpftrace takes for printf) becasue I was getting too many interleaving lines when using more.

TRACES:

================================================
trace_bio.out
Uses the two kernel probes blk_account_io_start() and blk_account_io_done() to trace block IO requests.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TIMESTAMP: 		nsecs since boot
TIME:			local time
PID: 			process pid
COMM: 			process name
DONEPID:		PID of process in whose context the blk_account_io_done probe executes. (See note 1)
DONECOMM: 		name of process with above PID
DISK: 			always sda since I filtered for it.
T: 			    request type. W = Write, R = Read.
SECTOR: 		disk sector requested (__sector field of struct request in blk_account_io_start call)
BYTES: 			size of requested data (__data_len field of struct request in blk_account_io_start call)
LAT(ns):		difference btw timestamp of blk_account_io_start and blk_account_io_done calls

Note 1: In Brendan Gregg's book BPF Performance Tools we read the following at the end of 9.3.2:
"The blk_account_io_start() function often fires in process context and occurs when the I/O is queued. Later events,
such as issuing the I/O to the device and I/O completion, may or may not happen in process context, so you cannot rely
on the value of the pid and comm builtins at those later times. The solution is to store them in BPF maps during
blk_account_io_start(), keyed by the request ID, so that they can be retrieved later."
This hints that even the start probe does not always start in process context, which was observed during other experiments.

================================================
trace_openat.out

traces calls to the openat() syscall using the sys_enter_openat() and sys_exit_openat() tracepoints.
We also intercept the associated vfs_open() calls here to get the filename in case the truncated path retrieved from openat() probe hides it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TIMESTAMP:		nsecs since boot
TIME:			local time
PID:			process pid
FD:             The returned file descriptor (negative if error)
LAT (ns)		call latency in nsecs (difference btw the timestamps of enter and exit tracepoints or kprobe and kretprobe)
FULLPATH        full path of filename, truncated to 63 chars
FILENAME		opened file (note 4)

Note 2: We only need trace openat() and not the open() syscall because "In modern Linux systems (glibc >= 2.26)
the open wrapper always calls the openat syscall."

================================================
trace_read.out
Traces calls to read() syscalls using tracepoints.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TIMESTAMP: 		nsecs since boot
PID:			process pid
FD:			    file descriptor
RET (B):		number of bytes read (return value of syscall)
LAT (ns):		timsetamp difference between enter and exit probes
FILE:			filename

================================================
trace_write.out
Traces calls to write() syscalls using tracepoints. Also intercepts vfs_write() calls to get the filename.
Due to less write activity, I was able to included more fields here in multiple printf calls without getting interleaving lines.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TIMESTAMP: 		nsecs since boot
PID:			process pid
FD:			    file descriptor
BUFFER ADDR:    address at which the write was issued
OFFSET:         offset from the buffer address at which write was issued
REQ (B):		given size of the write (count argument of the syscall)
RET (B):		number of bytes written (return value of syscall)
LAT (ns):		timsetamp difference between enter and exit tracepoints
FILENAME:       filename

================================================
unet3d.log
Application log of the workload (uses mlperf_logging module). Has UNIX timestamps.

================================================
gpu.out
Output of `nvidia-smi pmon` showing GPU usage metrics every second.
Column definition is not 100% certain as the output of pmon is not precisely detailed in the ref.
Ref: https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/DCGM/docs/nvidia-smi-367.38.pdf
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		YYYYMMDD
Time:		HH:MM:SS
gpu:		index of GPU (0 to 7)
pid:		process using the GPU
type: 		Type of the process. C=Compute, G=Graphics. Always C in this case.
sm:			% of time over the past sample period during which one or more kernels was executing on the GPU. (SM = Streaming Multiprocessor = GPU processor) 
mem:		% of time over the past sample period during which global (device) memory was being read or written. 
enc:  		% of time over the past sample period during which the GPU's video encoder was being used.
